# Nitrogen Framework

This project was an attempt (and a failed one) to try authoring
a PHP framework for general release.  It ended up being a 
tremendous learning experience on what happens under the hood
in a framework and provided a newly found gratitude towards the
work framework authors put in.

_Note: Hopefully this goes without saying...but DO NOT use this
framework. There is no useful documentation and there are a bevy
of well written and feature rich options to choose from for your
PHP projects!_
